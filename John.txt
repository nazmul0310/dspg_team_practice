  My names is John Malla, I am a CMDA major following the cyber-security track. I will be a rising fourth year in Fall 2022.
  Being able to take part in the DSPG program means a lot to me. I have always been looking to be able to take concepts away from the classroom and to be able to apply them in a real world situation is nice.
