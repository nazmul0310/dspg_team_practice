## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r John's Chunk}
hist(mtcars$mpg, main = "John's Graph")


# Map data
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
DSM_HARV <- raster("data/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
summary(DSM_HARV)

#dsmCrop
DSM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_HARV, xy=TRUE)
ggplot() + geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + ggtitle("John's Graph") + 
  coord_quickmap()

#rgb
Ortho_wNA <- raster("data/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif")
Ortho_wNa_df <- as.data.frame(Ortho_wNA, xy=TRUE)

ggplot() + geom_raster(data = Ortho_wNa_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_Ortho_wNA)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + ggtitle("John's Graph") + 
  coord_quickmap()
```
Using our two data files, I used them to create rasters, which I then converted to data frames so that `geom_raster` would work better on them. I titled both graphs as "John's Graph" as a title to clarify.
